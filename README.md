# Spoketoberfest Resources

Welcome to Spoketoberfest. For the last several years, the ServiceNow Developer Program has presented a mechanism for participating in Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest project.

This year we are asking for interested developers to work on building Spokes for IntegrationHub. There are a lot of APIs and protocols in the world yet to have an integration. When those actions exist, the act of connecting ServiceNow to the external systems will be much easier, and much more work will happen faster. The contributions if merged into the provided repos will be under the MIT licenses on those repos. To that end, let's get building and sharing!

First, sign up for [Hacktoberfest at Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). They will ask you to OAuth to GitHub to link those together. Once you do, you are registered for the challenge.

Next, go to the [Getting Started guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). You can find projects that interest you there. If you want to be a maintainer, you can claim a project. If you wish to contribute, follow the instructions to create your fork, and start building.

Note that this year, to qualify for the Hacktoberfest shirt you must:

1. Make four pull requests that meet minimum quality standards (aren't automated or spam, etc.)
2. Be in the first 40,000 qualifying users. This year, in particular, procrastination may cost you the shirt if that matters to you.

## Questions?

Thanks to everyone that builds and contributes. If you have any issues, feel free to find us on the #hacktoberfest channel on the [sndevs.com](https://sndevs.com/) Slack workspace
